# LBMTensorBuffer

!syntax description /TensorBuffers/LBMTensorBuffer

This object provides common tensor buffers for Lattice Boltzmann simulations. `df` type buffer adds distribution functions with extra dimension of size Q which corresponds to the choice of stencil. `mv` type buffer adds macroscopic vectorial buffers such as velocity and force. `ms` type buffer adds macroscopic scalar buffers such as density and speed.
