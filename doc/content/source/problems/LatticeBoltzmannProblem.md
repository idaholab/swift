# LatticeBoltzmannProblem

!syntax description /Problem/LatticeBoltzmannProblem

The problem object derived from TensorProblem (/TensorProblem.md) is used to solve Lattice Boltzmann simulations. It works in the same way as TensorProblem, with a few extra features. It adds stencil and boundary condition object and modifies the initialization and execution order in favor of LBM.
