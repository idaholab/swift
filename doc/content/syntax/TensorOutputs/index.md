# TensorOutputs System

The `TensorOutputs` system is a custom asynchronous Swift output system that directly writes tensor data to files without
projection to a mesh. At teh time of outputting it creates copies ofa all tensors slated for output and launches the
respective `TensorOutputs` in a separate thread. This allows teh simulation to progress while data is written to disk, resulting
in a high compute device utilization.
